# Lung_Cancer_Classification
<h1>Introduction</h1>
An important predictor of therapy effectiveness and prognosis in lung cancer is the tumour histology. However, current developments in deep learning for medical image processing reveal that radiologic data can be beneficial for further characterising disease features and clinical risk. Tissue collection for pathologist evaluation is still the most accurate way for histology categorization.

In this work, we present a radiomics approach for the histology of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours to be predicted using CT data. We built and validated convolutional neural networks with a focus on the two most prevalent histological forms, adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (CNNs).

We compared the CNN model with various Algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF). In diverse test sets, our best-performing CNN performed as a robust probabilistic classifier, with qualitatively interpretable visual explanations for its predictions. Deep learning-based radiomics can recognise histological traits in lung cancer.

We also developed the App as a user interface and deployed our best model in app using Android Studio Software.
